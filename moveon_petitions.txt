Description: As parent and grandparents, as educators, and as concerned community members, we stand in solidarity with Boston students as they prepare for #bpswalkout on Monday, March 7, 2016.

We could not be more proud of our young people. They are organizing to let the city and state know how much they value their schools, their education, and their right to participate in civic conversation. Our students understand that the proposed budget cuts will have a devastating impact on their education - and they are taking responsible, public action to register their dissent in response.

We love these young people, whom we have nurtured and taught from childhood. They are now ready to advocate for themselves, and we respect them for it.

We call upon all of Boston to support its youth as they take center stage on Monday.

In solidarity, and with great admiration for our students, I sign this petition.
Why: BPS students came up with the idea and have led all of the organizing related to #bpswalkout. This petition is our way of letting the students involved know that the adults in their community support their efforts.

Signatures: 1 of 100 Signatures
Description: It's time that the MBTA invest in bigger and of course, clean energy, buses for all of us who rely on public transportation in this city. People are crammed in like cattle in buses that are too small to safely fit all who need a ride. The last thing we want in the morning or any time we need to get somewhere is for a full bus to pass us by only to wait 30 or more minutes for the next ride. Other cities are advanced enough for double-deckers, why aren't we?
Why: It's time that the MBTA invest in bigger and of course, clean energy buses for all of us who rely on public transportation in this city.

Creator: Shaari Neretin
Signatures: 374 of 400 Signatures
Description: Neo-Nazis are planning a rally on the Boston Common on Sat. August 19th. Given their recently proven activity in Charlottesville, VA of hate speech, violence, and Murder, we urge that the permit for this rally be pulled. We must continue to stand up and protect and defend us all.
Why: This is not about stopping free speech. This is about protecting the citizenry from this murderous, violent, and unlawful group.

Update: Sun pm - Thus far, there is no permit. Marty Walsh has made a statement that said that thus far the group that requested the permit- a different name from the Charlottesville group - has not completed the process for a permit.

Title: Recognize Indigenous Peoples Day in Boston
URL: https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/recognize-indigenous-1
Creator: Parker Breza
Signatures: 3,604 of 4,000 Signatures
Description: We call on the Boston City Council to pass a resolution declaring Indigenous Peoples Day on the second Monday of October.
Why: All over the country and throughout the Americas, cities and towns are ending the celebration of Columbus. He was certainly not a hero, nor did he “discover” a continent that was already inhabited by many millions of Indigenous Peoples. Columbus and his men were responsible for the rape, murder and enslavement of countless Native people. It’s time for Boston to join Cambridge, Seattle, Denver, Albuquerque and many other cities and recognize Indigenous Peoples Day!

Since the 1970s, Indigenous Peoples from throughout the Americas have sought to have Indigenous Peoples Day declared in October in place of Columbus Day. We consider it a first step in recognizing the genocide of millions of Indigenous people and the theft of their lands that began with the arrival of Columbus.

Indigenous Peoples Day is much more than a name change. It is a refusal to allow the genocide of Indigenous Peoples to go unremembered. It is also an initial step in honoring and reconciling with present-day Native Peoples who live in and near Boston. Commemorating Indigenous Peoples Day on the second Monday in October is a recognition that we need to stop honoring false heroes such as Columbus and start honoring the Native Peoples on whose land we live and walk.

Title: Bring back rent control in Boston
URL: https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/bring-back-rent-control
Creator: Eileen Ridge
Signatures: 127 of 200 Signatures
Description: Protect low to moderate income residents, support House bill No. 1316.
Why: There is nowhere in the country where someone working a full-time minimum-wage job could afford to rent a modest two-bedroom apartment, according to an annual report released in 2018 by the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. In Boston, you’d need to earn
$ 33.46 an hour.
This simple fact is the crux of the current housing crisis in Boston, and the result is a spike in what is known as the shelter poverty phenomenon: the deprivation of non-shelter necessities resulting from the gap between income and housing costs.
In 1995 , one year after the elimination of rent control in Boston,the median rent for a 2 bedroom in Boston was 882.00. Today, that same 2-bedroom unit costs 2,194.00. In Roxbury, currently one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the most recent wave of gentrification, the median cost of housing rose 70% between 2010 and 2015. As a result of the removal of the protection of rent control, longtime residents are forced out, the population becomes more transient and the fabric of the neighborhood is weakened.
Lack of decent, affordable housing negatively impacts the health, well being and economic security of the citizens of Boston. Rent control is one solution among many that we need to implement to protect the poor and the working class from the greed of real estate developers.

Title: Bicyclists' Urban Ring at Boston Common
URL: https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/bicyclists-urban-ring
Creator: Alan Christ
Signatures: 1 of 100 Signatures
Description: The city of Boston should build separated two-way cycle tracks around the entire perimeter of Boston Common (a Bicyclists' Urban Ring), as well as along Charles Street in Beacon Hill. The Charles Street tracks would replace one lane of traffic, which could be recovered in rush hour by not allowing parallel parking on one side of the street. Bicycle traffic signals should be added along the entirety of this route.
Why: Boston's bicycle network currently has a gaping hole at its center which limits the functionality of existing bicycle lanes in the city. Tell Mayor Menino that Boston deserves a new "Bicyclists' Urban Ring" which would fully connect the many bike lanes that radiate outwards from Boston Common towards neighborhoods throughout the Boston Metropolitan Area.

This ring would be composed of two primary parts:

1. Boston Common "Bicyclists' Urban Ring": Separated 2-way cycle tracks would encircle the entire perimeter of the Common and the Public Garden with spur connections down Tremont, Charles, and Arlington Streets.

2. Beacon Hill Cycle Track: A two-way cycle track on Charles St in Beacon Hill would connect Cambridge Street, Esplanade, and Longfellow Bridge bicycle traffic to Boston Common. One traffic lane would need to be removed to achieve this goal, but it could be recovered during rush hour if parallel parking was not allowed during peak commute times.

Adding these crucial links would greatly increase the number of safe options for bicyclists traveling through downtown, without inconveniencing cars or pedestrians. Including bicycle traffic lights along these routes would also maximize safety for bicyclists and pedestrians. I urge you to sign this petition and voice your support for improved bicycle safety in downtown Boston.
